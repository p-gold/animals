# Animals specie (spiders and dogs)

The project animals is a web work that focused on animals particularly spiders and dogs. The project was designed in such a way that when a person who knows nothing about the two animals (spiders and dogs) visits the site, after reading articles about a particular one, he will have a sound knowledge on the two animals.

When you open the project(site), you can access your desired animal by hovering to the navigation bar, then click on spiders or dogs depending on the one you want to view or read about. when clicked, a dropdown will appear with a list of the animals, hover to your desired one and click.
