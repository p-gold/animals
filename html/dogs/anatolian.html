            <h4>History</h4>

             <p>The Anatolian Shepherd Dog is a native of Turkey, where he was developed as a shepherd’s companion and livestock guardian. He was bred to resemble the size and color of the livestock he defended so predators would not detect him among the flock. Sometimes called the Anatolian Karabash Dog, he’s a fiercely loyal guard dog and a large, impressive dog breed, weighing 120 to 150 pounds at maturity.</p><p>The Anatolian Shepherd Dog is a considered a livestock protector or guardian dog. As such, he was developed to live with the flock and adopt it as his own. He is a rugged, self-confident guardian who knows how much protection or intimidation is necessary in any situation.

              The Anatolian has been working independently for centuries, making decisions regarding threats to his property. As a puppy, he adopts whomever he lives with, be it a family or a herd of sheep; as he grows, he takes on the protector gig. It doesn't matter to the Anatolian whether his "flock" is human or animal — he is extremely protective and possessive.
              
              And he backs up his guardian nature with presence. The Anatolian is a large dog, weighing as much as 150 pounds. He has a short, fawn coat and a black mask. He appears intimidating, and if necessary he is — though he's calm and friendly with his family.
              
              Not surprisingly for a guard dog, the Anatolian Shepherd is suspicious of strangers and reserved with those outside his "flock." He takes his job seriously — this dog is no clown — and when his owner isn't home, he is unlikely to allow even friends or extended family members whom he's met before to come onto his property.
              
              At the same time, the Anatolian is a very intelligent, loyal, steady working dog. He's highly trainable, though he's likely to consider whether or not he will choose to obey a command, due to his independent nature. He needs an owner who is strong, kind, and consistent as a pack leader.
              
              This breed is probably not a good choice as a family pet if you have very young children. Because he's so large, he could accidentally injure a small child, especially when he's a clumsy, growing puppy (the phrase "bull in a china shop" applies).
              
              Additionally, the Anatolian typically does not respect children as pack leaders, and he could decide to protect his children from visiting playmates if they're roughhousing and the dog misinterprets the activity. Generally, the Anatolian is tolerant of older children and is good with them. To him they are, of course, part of the flock that needs guarding, along with the rest of the family.
              
              The Anatolian Shepherd is not the perfect breed for everyone. He can be a fine and loyal companion if you and your family understand his unique qualities and requirements and are ready to take on the responsibility of owning a very large and protective dog.
              
              If you need a dog to protect a flock or herd, find a breeder who breeds successful livestock guardians: you'll have a better outcome if the puppy or adult you purchase already has successful working dogs in his bloodline.
              
              When looking for a family companion, focus on proper breed temperament. Find a good breeder with experience with this dog's character, and you'll be able to look forward to many years of companionship with a loyal, protective guardian for your family.</p>

          <h4>Size</h4>
                <p>Males stand 29 inches tall and weigh 110 to 150 pounds. Females stand 27 inches tall and weigh 80 to 120 pounds.</p>

          <h4>Personality</h4>
              <p>The Anatolian Shepherd Dog is highly intelligent, independent, and dominant. He thinks for himself — a necessary characteristic for a livestock guardian. He's very protective of his family and flock, and he considers himself to be constantly on duty.

                Though protective, the Anatolian Shepherd is calm, friendly, and affectionate with his immediate family. He is not friendly with strangers and is very reserved with those outside his family, even if they're friends or relatives of yours.
                
                Temperament is affected by a number of factors, including heredity, training, and socialization. Puppies with nice temperaments are curious and playful, willing to approach people and be held by them. Choose the middle-of-the-road puppy, not the one who's beating up his littermates or the one who's hiding in the corner.
                
                Always meet at least one of the parents — usually the mother is the one who's available — to ensure that they have nice temperaments that you're comfortable with. Meeting siblings or other relatives of the parents is also helpful for evaluating what a puppy will be like when he grows up.
                
                Like every dog, the Anatolian Shepherd needs early socialization — exposure to many different people, sights, sounds, and experiences — when they're young. Socialization helps ensure that your Anatolian Shepherd puppy grows up to be a well-rounded dog.
                
                Enrolling him in a puppy kindergarten class is a great start. Inviting visitors over regularly, and taking him to busy parks, stores that allow dogs, and on leisurely strolls to meet neighbors will also help him polish his social skills.</p>

            <h4>Care</h4>
                <p>The Anatolian Shepherd is a hardy dog and can adapt to living outdoors, indoors, or both. He does not do well living in a kennel or at the end of a chain, however. He should be kept in a securely fenced yard — a fence at least six feet tall is required for this big breed — not only for his protection but also for the protection of dogs or people who might inadvertently enter his turf, which he will defend with all his might.

                  Because he is naturally wary of new people, animals, and situations, the Anatolian Shepherd must be socialized right from puppyhood. Obedience training and consistent leadership are also essential, because the Anatolian is so strong-willed. This dog has his own ideas, and he won't cater to his owner's every whim.
                  
                  The Anatolian Shepherd will guard and protect without any protection training; in fact, attack training is not recommended for this breed. His protective nature grows as he matures; by the time he's about 18 months old, he usually voluntarily takes on the role of guardian</p>

              <h4>Feeding</h4>
                  <p>Recommended daily amount: 4 to 6 cups of high-quality dry food a day, divided into two meals.

                    NOTE: How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.
                    
                    Keep your Anatolian Shepherd in good shape by measuring his food and feeding him twice a day rather than leaving food out all the time. If you're unsure whether he's overweight, give him the eye test and the hands-on test.
                    
                    First, look down at him. You should be able to see a waist. Then place your hands on his back, thumbs along the spine, with the fingers spread downward. You should be able to feel but not see his ribs without having to press hard. If you can't, he needs less food and more exercise.</p>

                <h4>Coat and grooming color</h4>
                    <p>The Anatolian Shepherd Dog's coat is short (about an inch long) with a thick undercoat. Sometimes there is feathering on the ears, legs, and tail. His coat comes in many colors, including pinto, white, and brindle, but fawn with a black mask is common.

                      The Anatolian Shepherd is naturally clean, so he' no big handful in the grooming department. The breed's short coat requires minimal brushing, but you can expect profuse shedding several times year. Extra brushing during those times helps remove dead hair. Minimal bathing, three to four times a year, is all that's needed.
                      
                      Brush your Anatolian Shepherd's teeth at least two or three times a week to remove tartar buildup and the bacteria that lurk inside it. Daily brushing is even better if you want to prevent gum disease and bad breath.
                      
                      Trim his nails once or twice a month if your dog doesn't wear them down naturally to prevent painful tears and other problems. If you can hear them clicking on the floor, they're too long. Dog toenails have blood vessels in them, and if you cut too far you can cause bleeding — and your dog may not cooperate the next time he sees the nail clippers come out. So, if you're not experienced trimming dog nails, ask a vet or groomer for pointers.
                      
                      His ears should be checked weekly for redness or a bad odor, which can indicate an infection. When you check your dog's ears, wipe them out with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to help prevent infections. Don't insert anything into the ear canal; just clean the outer ear.
                      
                      Begin accustoming your Anatolian Shepherd to being brushed and examined when he's a puppy. Handle his paws frequently — dogs are touchy about their feet — and look inside his mouth. Make grooming a positive experience filled with praise and rewards, and you'll lay the groundwork for easy veterinary exams and other handling when he's an adult.
                      
                      As you groom, check for sores, rashes, or signs of infection such as redness, tenderness, or inflammation on the skin, in the nose, mouth, and eyes, and on the feet. Eyes should be clear, with no redness or discharge. Your careful weekly exam will help you spot potential health problems early.</p>

                  <h4>children and pets</h4>
                      <p>The Anatolian Shepherd is loving with his family, including the children, with whom he's calm and protective. But because of his large size, he's probably better suited to families with older children. He's unlikely to respect young children as leaders, so all interactions between the Anatolian and children should be supervised by responsible adults.

                        As with every breed, you should always teach children how to approach and touch dogs to prevent any biting or ear or tail pulling on the part of either party. Teach your child never to approach any dog while he's eating or sleeping or to try to take the dog's food away. No dog, no matter how friendly, should ever be left unsupervised with a child.
                        
                        The best chance of the Anatolian Shepherd accepting other dogs and pets is to raise him with them from puppyhood. As he grows, he'll naturally accept them as part of his "flock."
