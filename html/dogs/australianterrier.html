            <h4>History</h4>
               <p>The Australian Terrier was developed in Australia, as his name implies. Bred to hunt and exterminate rodents and snakes, Australian Terriers were also prized as watchdogs and companions. Today, the Australian Terrier dog breed maintains those same characteristics: he is a delightful companion, a fierce earthdog competitor, and a conformation and obedience showman.</p><p>    The Australian Terrier, called an "Aussie" by his admirers (although he's not to be confused with an Australian Shepherd), is a small terrier with upright ears and a rough, shaggy coat. He is the littlest of the working terriers, but don't let his size fool you. He's definitely a lot of dog in a tiny package, with a typical terrier slant on life: tenacious, independent, hardworking, and lively.

                With a spirited, mischievous personality, the Aussie jumps into life with attitude. But he's usually strongly attached to his family — so strongly attached that he'll often match his mood to yours. If you've got the blues, he is calm and quiet. If you're happy and excited, he turns frisky and playful.
            
                Mostly, the Aussie is upbeat, active, and silly, clowning around and entertaining his owners. He has an affinity for the young, the elderly, and the disabled. He makes an excellent playmate for a child, although adults should supervise interactions with very young children: Australian Terriers are not snappy or aggressive, but they do have limits on the handling and roughhousing they will tolerate.
            
                He may be small, but the Australian Terrier has the confidence of a large breed. He is a wonderful watchdog and will bark to alert his owners of the approach of anyone or anything new and different.
            
                Since they're so intelligent, Australian Terriers will readily learn whatever you're teaching (so be sure you don't inadvertently teach your Aussie pup that it's okay to jump up on you or chase the cat — or he'll keep up the behavior throughout his adulthood as well). Repetitive training is a bore for these bundles of energy, so lessons must be fun and increasingly challenging. Also, the independent Aussie likes to think the schooling is all his idea. Positive, reward-based training works wonders.
            
                Since the breed was developed as a working terrier, the Aussie instinct to chase and kill small animals — including squirrels, rabbits, mice, and cats — is strong. A securely fenced yard is essential, as is leash training. If you have rodents or other small pets, you need to introduce your Aussie to them when he's a young puppy, and teach him from the start that they are off limits. This can be very difficult — in truth, the best strategy is to never allow the Aussie to gain access to them. He can live with cats if he grows up with them and is taught to leave them alone, but he's likely to consider all felines outside your household to be fair game.
            
                If you like a pristine lawn or showplace garden, an Australian Terrier may not be the breed for you. Like all terriers, he loves to dig — it's in his breeding — and if left unsupervised for too long, he'll decide that tearing up the lawn is an ideal way to amuse himself.
            
                Even though he stands a mere 10 inches tall and weighs about 14 pounds, this is one confident breed. The spunky Aussie will challenge other dogs, including those much bigger than he is. He can be aggressive and bossy to other dogs in his household.</p>  

            <h4>Size</h4>
                <p>Both males and females stand 10 to 11 inches tall and weigh 14 to 16 pounds.</p>

            <h4>Personality</h4>
                <p>The Aussie is a fun-loving, upbeat dog who makes a great companion for any individual or family who wants to share his energetic lifestyle. Devoted to his owners, he's happiest when he's part of daily family life. He likes to be in the house, playing with the kids, following you room to room, or shouldering his way to the front door when you greet a friend. He is clever and should be easy to train — as long as you keep him busy and never, ever bore him.</p>

            <h4>Care</h4>
                  <p>The Aussie enjoys the company of his human companions and does best when living in the house, not left to his own devices in the yard — which he will dig up like a gopher if given the chance. Your flowerbeds might stand a chance if you can train him to dig only in one designated spot in the yard, but don't bet on it. Chances are he'll make up his own mind about the best digging areas.

                    You'll be better off if you supervise him closely when he's in the yard. Don't leave him alone too long or he'll be overcome by temptation, and your tidy landscaping will be only a memory. You must also fence your backyard to live amicably with your Aussie, who will take off after any cat, rat, or rabbit he sees if he's not confined or supervised on a leash.
                    
                    Since all dogs in the Terrier group tend to be bossy and aggressive around other dogs, proper socialization of your Aussie puppy is a must. Regular obedience training, beginning with puppy classes, is not only fun but is essential with this breed. Keep in mind, though, that the Aussie is a quick study — don't bore him by practicing the same lessons over and over.
                    
                    In fact, you may find that your intelligent Aussie is the type who loves progressively challenging levels of obedience classes and agility training. Motivation is key: the task at hand must be challenging and fun, and you must offer an irresistible incentive, such as treats, toys, or verbal praise. You don't work for free, and neither does the Aussie.
                    
                    Begin crate training when he's a puppy. This will help you housetrain him, and it provides him with a welcome refuge as well as a familiar means of safe travel when he's in the car.
                    
                    The spirited Aussie needs plenty of exercise — ideally, several brisk walks a day. He remains active well into his golden years.</p>

                <h4>Feeding</h4>
                    <p>Recommended daily amount: 1/2 to 1 cup dry food a day.

                      Unlike some small breeds, the Aussie is not a fussy eater. He has a hearty appetite, though he doesn't usually overeat. For more on feeding your Australian Terrier, see our guidelines for buying the right food, feeding your puppy, and feeding your adult dog.
                      </p><p><em> NOTE:</em> How much your adult dog eats depends on his size, age, build, metabolism, and activity level. Dogs are individuals, just like people, and they don't all need the same amount of food. It almost goes without saying that a highly active dog will need more than a couch potato dog. The quality of dog food you buy also makes a difference — the better the dog food, the further it will go toward nourishing your dog and the less of it you'll need to shake into your dog's bowl.</p>

                 <h4>Coat color and grooming</h4>
                      <p>The Aussie's shaggy coat is rough to the touch, with a soft undercoat. About two inches in length over most of the body, it is longer on the chest and head. It comes in three color types: blue and tan (tan body with a blue saddle), sandy, and red.
                            <p>
                        The Aussie sheds minimally, and it's easy to groom him. Brush him once a week, trim his toenails once a month, and bathe him as needed — usually every three months or so, unless he has rolled in a scent that only a dog could love. Frequent bathing isn't recommended because it softens the coarse terrier coat. While a soft coat isn't harmful to any dog and is fine for a pet, it does detract from a show Aussie's physical appearance.</p>
                             
                        Check the ears once a week for dirt, redness, or a bad odor that can indicate an infection. Also wipe them out weekly with a cotton ball dampened with gentle, pH-balanced ear cleaner to prevent problems.</p>
