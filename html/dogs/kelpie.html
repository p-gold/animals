            <h4>History</h4>
                  <p>The Australian Kelpie was originally bred to have the energy, intelligence, and independence to herd livestock all day in the hot Australian climate without much need for supervision, and the breed retains those qualities to this day. Australian Kelpies are still used across Australia and the United States for their herding instincts, and that suits these dogs just fine, as they are happiest when they have a job to do. Those who want to keep an Australian Kelpie as a pet would do well to remember that, as a bored Australian Kelpie may make their own fun by acting out and engaging in destructive behavior. The good news is that these dogs are easy to train for almost any task, so long as they have a confident, competent trainer who can give positive reinforcement without being too harsh. Australian Kelpies are fully capable of performing many dog sports, search and rescue work, nose work, service dog duties, and more. They have high energy and high exercise needs, and while they are able to handle doing a job with little supervision, they need human companionship and direction. Leaving them home alone for long periods of time can spell disaster. Their natural herding instincts need to be contained and used properly from an early age, or they may end up nipping at the heels of children, other pets, and even guests, but with time and training, they can make loyal companions who excel as watchdogs and work tirelessly at any task theyâ€™re given</p>

              <h4>Size</h4>
                  <p>Australian Kelpies are medium-sized dogs, typically weighing between 25 and 46 pounds. They usually measure 15 to 20 inches at the shoulder. Individuals of the breed may be smaller or larger.</p>

              <h4>Personality</h4>
                  <p>Australian Kelpies have an independent streak that is very beneficial for herding work, but it also means that they need to be mentally challenged, or they may grow bored and engage in destructive behavior. Despite this independent nature, Australian Kelpies should not be left without human company for long, least of all when they are cooped up indoors. They have a sensitive side that doesn't respond well to harsh rebukes or punishment, but a competent trainer that relies on positive reinforcement will find that these dogs are more than smart enough to follow commands, even at long distances. Australian Kelpies are not overly trusting of strangers, and they are very territorial. Although this makes them great watchdogs who will bark at any sign of danger, it also means they need socialization training from an early age, and it may be best for them if neighboring pets are not allowed to wander on the property. They need to learn when it is appropriate to react with suspicion and when to allow guests to approach.</p>

              <h4>Care</h4>
                  <p>Australian Kelpies require fairly little regular care. Their nails will usually file down naturally as they walk, though they should be checked for damage and trimmed if necessary. Teeth should be brushed regularly as recommended by a veterinarian. Their ears should be checked for signs of debris, parasites, or infection and kept clean. Baths should be given as needed.</p>

              <h4>Feeding</h4>
                  <p>An Australian Kelpie diet should be formulated for a mid-sized breed with high energy and intense exercise requirements. You should consult your veterinarian or professional nutritionist for advice on what to feed your Australian Kelpie and the correct portion sizes. Their dietary needs will change as they grow from puppyhood to adulthood and senior age. Stay on top of these nutritional requirements</p>

              <h4>Coat color and grooming</h4>
                  <p>Australian Kelpie coats can be short, rough, or smooth and come in several different beautiful colors. They can be black, red, chocolate, black with tan markings, red with tan markings, smokey blue, or fawn. The Australian Kelpie's grooming needs are low to moderate. A brushing or two per week should help remove dead hair and reduce shedding. They often have double coats with the outer coat being more weather-resistant. Australian Kelpies tend to shed more heavily in the spring, so they may need extra brushing during that time.</p>

              <h4>Children and other pets</h4>
                  <p>The natural herding instincts of the Australian Kelpie can make it hard for them to live with small children or other pets, as they have a tendency to nip in order to round up whoever or whatever they feel needs to be herded. Their distrust of strangers may also make things difficult when children have young friends over. However, all of these tendencies can be kept under control and redirected to constructive behaviors with the right training, especially if socialization training begins early in life. If you plan to adopt an Australian Kelpie into your family, make sure you are prepared to give them the training they need to provide everyone with a safe and positive living environment, including your new pup.</p>
