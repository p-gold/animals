                  <h4>Description</h4>
                  <p>

                    The Violin Spider is another common name for the Brown Recluse Spider. They are well known for the
                    look and design that features a type of violin drawing. They only have 6 sets of eyes which is
                    interesting considering others have 8 sets of eyes.

                    These Spiders are less than 1 inch long. They come in all shades of brown with a medium coloration
                    being the most common. You will also find those out there that are black, cream, or gray. This is
                    why people are often not sure of what type of Spider they happened to see or not.

                    Their location also affects the type of coloration that they will feature. It is a natural way for
                    them to be able to blend in well with their surrounding area. They need this camouflage to help
                    them be able to successfully hide from predators. They are one of the hairy types of Spiders as
                    well.</p>

                  <h4>Behaviour</h4>
                  <p>The stance that the Brown Recluse Spider is able to show very good posture. The legs are also
                    known to be all on the ground all the time. The only time when this won’t happen is when they are
                    in a posture to show assertiveness. This allows them to lift the front legs so that they can show
                    that they aren’t going to back down from the threats.

                    They move along at a slow pace though so if they don’t feel that they have to stand up to a threat
                    they won’t. They may move back slowly though so that they can keep a good set of eyes on potential
                    threats around them.</p>

                <section>
                  <h4>Distribution</h4>
                  <p>You will find the Brown Recluse Spider out there in many places. They tend to live in areas where
                    humans haven’t disturbed things for a while. This can mean your shed, your attic, and even a
                    storage unit. They may be outdoors in wood piles or behind various items that you have placed out
                    there but not used for quite some time.

                    It isn’t uncommon for people in many areas to discover this type of Spider in their home due to the
                    heat that is generated there. This will be very common during the times when the weather outdoors
                    is going to begin to cool down.</p>

                  <h4>Diet</h4>
                  <p>Being able to consume a wide selection of food in their natural habitat is encouraging for the
                    Brown Recluse Spider. They don’t have to worry about finding only one time of meal around them.
                    They are mainly going to enjoy fresh kills that get caught up in their webs. <p>When they get the
                      chance to create a web for live catches they will drop down to it as soon as they can. They don’t
                      want to risk the prey breaking through the web and escaping. Some of the items they will catch
                      include crickets and cockroaches.</p>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then venom is injected that they will use to help them reduce the tissue consistency of the body.
                    They have to consume only liquid so they will allow the prey to stay there until it gets to a
                    liquefied consistency. Then they will consume what they can, leaving the shells of their prey
                    behind. However, they aren’t opposed to eating what they find that is already dead out there.</p>

                <section>
                  <h4>Reproduction</h4>
                  <p>There is only a certain period of time when the Brown Recluse Spider will be able to deposit her
                    eggs. This is during the hotter periods of the year – May, June, and July. She may have hundreds of
                    eggs at once time, but she can also hurry and mate twice during that three month span. This is very
                    common so she will have a double batch of eggs per year.

                    Before mating can take place though the females have to give the males permission. They can be very
                    particular when it comes to which one they will mate with. They will watch various activities by
                    the males that are quite interesting. Some of the males will bring food, they will dance too. These
                    movements can be entertaining with a variety of jumps and spins involved.</p>
